Day.fm

Log your Last.fm Top Weekly Artists and Tracks to your Day One journal

This simple script has a couple requirements in order to run:

1. You must have the Day One mac app installed (you can get it [here](http://bit.ly/DayOneMac))

2. Install the Day One CLI (you can get that [here](http://dayoneapp.com/downloads/dayone-cli.pkg))

3. Install the Ruby JSON tools.  *(In the terminal run the command `$ gem install json`)*

---

For now, to run the script go into the terminal and run the following command:

`$ ruby [PATH TO SCRIPT]/dayfm.rb [USERNAME]`

*(i.e. `$ ~/Documents/dayfm.rb mattbookpro`)*

I don't like that it has to be run manually, so I've been looking into getting OS X to run it for me on a schedule (like on Sundays when the new charts for the last week are released). If anybody has any suggestions about how to do this, email me at apps@mattbookpro.com.
